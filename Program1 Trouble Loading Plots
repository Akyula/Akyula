I started this on my Mac and wend away for the weekend.  I am doing this now on a borrowed Windows laptop and I am having trouble loading the plots
cant find correct git hub repository  so submitting what I have to beat the dealine,
I will try to the the plots into github
fighting getbash and know its my fault for starting late.
